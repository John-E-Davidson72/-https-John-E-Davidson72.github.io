title: Alternative learning techniques
---

As you can see from the gap in dates my blogging is not exactly consistent right now!  Itâ€™s tough to keep the plates spinning sometimes â€“ family, work, building web apps, Linkedin engagement etc, not to mention getting some downtimeâ€¦.  Which brings me to the point of this post.
How can you boost your learning if you are seriously time constrained?  **Here are some ideas;**
* First, the most obvious one - your mobile or tablet is a great reference asset â€“ optimise it;
  * Configure your browser â€“ organise relevant material into structured folders (latest Chrome mobile update is great for this) 
  * Search for PDF â€˜cheat sheetsâ€™ (Python ones are good examples), you can also make your own â€“ add these to your cloud storage & create desktop shortcuts
  * Books â€“ photograph relevant pages for later review
  * Youtube â€“ there are loads of focused 10 minute â€˜bitesizeâ€™ tech vids 
  * Document learnings or ideas on your phone â€“ use Evernote or something similar (I like the simplicity of [ColorNote](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.socialnmobile.dictapps.notepad.color.note&hl=en_GB&gl=US))
  * Podcasts â€“ listen on the move / in the car â€“ Spotify is a good resource for these
  * Use platforms optimised for mobile learning (see [SoloLearn](https://john-e-davidson72.github.io/my_website/sololearn/) post)
* Go old school â€“ get some books!  Cut down your screen time a bit, [this one is a great for expanding your Python knowledge](https://realpython.com/products/python-tricks-book/), I always have it to hand
* Always have a small note pad handy, [writing stuff down is proven to help retention](https://medium.com/skilluped/how-to-take-notes-for-maximum-retention-a87e9c63b14c)
* Try to leverage learnings quickly â€“ find a practical application or pain point that could be remedied by applying the knowledge youâ€™ve recently acquired
* Challenge your recall â€“ during a quiet period try and recall five key points from a topic you are working through

When youâ€™re under time-pressure, itâ€™s focus & consistency, not goals that win â€“ try the techniques above to see if they help you to retain information.  This could be before you take your next course assessment or certification exam, or if youâ€™re learning to implement a new library.  If you canâ€™t spend hours studying a topic, every minute counts.
If you do eventually have time to study properly youâ€™ll be on a better footing.  

Another thing to remember - donâ€™t fight your natural circadian clock!  Iâ€™m switched on in the morning and at night between 8pm â€“ 11pm, I tend to stick to these times if I can have longer study sessions.  Late afternoon and early evening are not good for me â€“ Iâ€™m a bit ðŸ˜© then ðŸ˜€.
You will forget stuff, there will be days when you wonâ€™t do anything meaningful, life will just get in the way â€“ but remember â€“ _**persistence always wins**_.
