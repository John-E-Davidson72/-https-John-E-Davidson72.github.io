Welcome to my Blog - **A Tech & Energy journey**

Interested in coding / tech but not sure where to start?  You'll find some great resources listed below.

Don't want to jump straight into 'serious' programming?  Have a look at how to create websites using HTML &
CSS - 'markup' coding is a great entry point.  Basically, HTML is the web page structure, CSS is what makes
a page look nice.

If you want to learn a high level programming language It's worth doing some research to find particular areas 
that interest you - for me it was web development coupled with data science - Python was a natural choice here.

If the web side floats your boat more, you're better off going down the JavaScript route, Python is ok for this but 
JavaScript really is the de-facto language of the web browser.

Both these languages are beginner friendly and a great place to start, check these links out;

[freeCodeCamp JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkZNo7MFNFg)

[MDN JavaScript first steps](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps)

You might be interested in mobile app development (who isn't?) - [Java](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/functional-programming-in-java-course/) is your go-to here for Android, however
the learning curve for this language is much steeper, also - note [Java and Javascript are not the same thing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-java-and-javascript/).

[Kotlin](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/kotlin-programming-basics-for-beginners/) is also used for mobile apps but it's recommended for beginners to learn Java first.

Javascript and Python can be 'transpiled' to Java, let's not go down that rabbit hole....

If you're into Apple stuff, [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) is your language - again not a high barrier to entry with this one (not an Apple fan though so haven't tried it).

[The charts in this article show the popularity of some other languages compared to Python](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/09/06/incredible-growth-python/). 

So what's stopping you?  All of the resources listed are totally **FREE!**

Microsoft also offer some great free content - I'm currently working through [Azure Cloud Fundamentals](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/azure-fundamentals/) - the courses are free but just be aware that there is a charge for the certification exams.

Cheers!
