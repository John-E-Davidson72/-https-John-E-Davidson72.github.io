Welcome to my Blog - **A Tech & Energy journey**

Interested in coding / tech but not sure where to start?  You'll find some great resources listed below.

Don't want to jump straight into 'serious' programming?  Have a look at how to create websites using HTML &
CSS - 'markup' coding is a great entry point.

It's worth doing some research to find particular areas that interest you - for me it was web development
coupled with data science - Python was a natural choice here.  If the web side floats your boat you're better
off going down the Javascript route, Python is ok for this but Javascript really is the de-facto language of the web.

Both these languages are beginner friendly and a great place to start, check these links out;

You might be interested in mobile app development (who isn't?) - Java is your go-to here for Android, however
the learning curve for this language is much steeper, also - note Java and Javascript are not the same thing.

If you're into Apple stuff, Swift is your language (it's meant to be one of the easier ones to pick up).

This chart shows the popularity of some other languages. 

So what's stopping you?  All of the resources listed are totally FREE!

Microsoft also offer some great free content - I'm currently working through Azure Cloud Fundamentals - the
course is free but just be aware that there is a charge for the exams.

Cheers!
