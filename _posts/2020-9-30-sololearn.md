[SoloLearn Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sololearn&hl=en_GB) [SoloLearn iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sololearn-learn-to-code/id1210079064)

Back when I was still deciding what coding route to go down (Python / JavasScript etc) a colleague of mine introduced me to SoloLearn.  As you can see Iâ€™ve racked up a few â€˜certsâ€™.
Is this platform worth your while if you want to learn to code?

**Yes and no.**

Here is the good:
* Free! (although you can pay for SoloLearn PRO)
* Nice, friendly user interface
* At a basic level, learning topics good and tutorials progress logically
* Learn anywhere!  (I did a lot of the JavaScript â€˜tutorialâ€™ while queuing at the supermarket)
* Wide range of languages / frameworks covered
* You can take on challenges and climb the user rankings
* Embedded interpreters â€“ enter & run code on your mobile

The bad:
* Section headlines like â€˜become a data scientistâ€™ / â€˜become a full stack developerâ€™ / â€˜become an expertâ€™ totally misleading
* Free tier ads intrusive / annoying
* Bit too â€˜gamifiedâ€™ â€“ my opinion, you might like this aspect
* Once youâ€™ve passed a few sections you can get hint points (have used them ðŸ˜¬)
* Usefulness of some content questionable for beginners
* Concepts like object-oriented programming covered but no context given on where or why you would use it
* Explanations of some language specifics can be a bit confusing, content limited to suit mobile user attention span
* â€˜By the communityâ€™ tutorials by-and-large not good â€“ these are basically a regurgitation of framework documentation, go to the source docs instead

TBH youâ€™d be better of buying a book or doing a proper online course in your chosen language â€“ check out [this post](https://john-e-davidson72.github.io/my_website/blog-up/).

However, some SoloLearn content is decent enough for reference, the rankings are fun (if thatâ€™s your thing), the platform is slick and easy to use - 
just donâ€™t take it too seriously.
