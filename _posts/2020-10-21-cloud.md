title: Can you trust your cloud provider?
---

If you are a large corporation â€“ yes â€“ but with some caveats (wonâ€™t go into those here).

But what if youâ€™re a private individual or small business owner who relies on software-as-a-service like Google Sheets or Microsoft Office online â€“ where do you stand?  If you leverage cloud storage, is it safe, reliable & always available?

If you are in one of these groups and are using cloud services from the â€˜big twoâ€™, data security really shouldnâ€™t be a concern, but what about availability?
[There have been instances where Googleâ€™s services were down](https://mashable.com/article/shopify-google-cloud-outage/?europe=true), causing serious business continuity problems for small organisations, [uptime issues have also affected Microsoft Azure recently](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/cooling-loss-causes-outage-microsoft-azures-uk-south-region/). 

Corporate entities will have defined SLAs (Service Level Agreements) that they enter into with a Cloud provider, they provide cover in two critical areas:

* Uptime guarantees
* What happens if uptime targets are not met

I did a bit of research into public SLAs and found these;

[Google]( https://support.google.com/googlecloud/answer/6056635?hl=en)

[Google Workspace]( https://workspace.google.com/terms/sla.html)

[Microsoft]( https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/servicesagreement/)

Google are quoting figures but you will notice that Microsoft arenâ€™t (see clause 6 and l for OneDrive).

All of this is pretty opaque â€“ so, without getting into an SLA research thesis what does this mean?

Letâ€™s assume worst case and lowest Google tier is where the bar is set for private users, 99% sounds great doesnâ€™t it?  But it isnâ€™t really â€“ in reality this equates to over three days per year cumulative downtime.  You can see from the incidents mentioned previously what this means in a real-world scenario.

Big organisations that run critical applications will look for â€˜five ninesâ€™ or 99.999% uptime which is five minutes per year.  They can also leverage service credits to claw back losses incurred by downtime.  You and I canâ€™t do that.

Thereâ€™s not much you can do about service outages if you are relying on a SaaS app for day-to-day business, but in terms of storage â€“ you could replicate another corporate model â€“ [the hybrid cloud](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/overview/what-is-hybrid-cloud-computing/).

This way you still store certain information â€˜on premisesâ€™ but also mirror selected data in the cloud.  You are probably already following this model using a portable hard drive (or you should be!), you should also use HD encryption and keep it in a secure location.

This model works for me as I live in an area with relatively poor broadband performance, upload speed is dire and moving to fibre wonâ€™t shift the needle much on this (for nowâ€¦).  Bulk uploads need to be run overnight and are unreliable ðŸ˜±.  To make a more effective home â€˜hybrid cloudâ€™ Iâ€™m going to [hook up a hard drive to the home network to make things a bit more integrated](https://www.cnet.com/how-to/share-an-external-hard-drive-over-a-wi-fi-network/).

In summary, the cloud **_should_** be your go-to solution â€“ current SaaS and storage offerings just canâ€™t be beaten.  But, if you regularly work with data thatâ€™s critical to business continuity or are affected by connectivity issues / broadband bottlenecks [you need a plan B](https://thenextweb.com/basics/2020/01/28/back-up-sync-google-docs/).
