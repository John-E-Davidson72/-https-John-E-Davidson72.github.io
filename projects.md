## New Machine Learning Project

Can't say much about this one right now! - Building this around some existing web resources, will leverage learnings from
chapter 1 of [this book](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-TensorFlow/dp/1492032646/ref=asc_df_1492032646/?tag=googshopuk-21&linkCode=df0&hvadid=375498709181&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=8546052863628994399&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=1007293&hvtargid=pla-523968811896&psc=1&th=1&psc=1&tag=&ref=&adgrpid=76471991426&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvadid=375498709181&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=8546052863628994399&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=1007293&hvtargid=pla-523968811896) (classic regression model should be a great fit).  Have already built some Flask scaffolding
to support the MVP app, getting a bit ahead of myself here but effort expended on this now will help later on in the
production phase.  There is even some JS creeping into the project - [this is a great JS reference for any Pythonista](https://realpython.com/python-vs-javascript/).
