![JD]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/me.jpg "me")

I live in Aberdeen, Scotland.

By day I work in the energy industry, bringing best-in-class products to the decommissioning market.
The great thing about my job is I also get to play in the tech space, working with digital technology
professionals to deliver high value software and analytics solutions.

My real passion & side gig is web development, although I also do a lot of data science work using Python's 
sci libraries.  I like to combine these two fields to build solutions to real, everyday problems.
